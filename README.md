# QUIDS
Q/U Integrated Dust Shells
(**QUIDS**) is a Python package for generating synthetic Stokes **Q** and **U** polarization maps from 3D dust density and Galactic magnetic field shell data. It computes polarized emission by integrating over spherical shells using input polarization angles derived from Galactic magnetic field models (e.g., UF23, JF12).
